# dbatools

> PowerShell Core (aka PowerShell 6+) went GA (generally available) and supported in January of 2018. Please be aware at this time we do not support this version of PowerShell. It is on the roadmap but at this time there is no estimated time we will be supporting it.

<img align="left" src=https://blog.netnerds.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/dbatools.png alt="dbatools logo">  dbatools is sort of like a command-line SQL Server Management Studio. The project initially started out as Start-SqlMigration.ps1, but has now grown into a collection of [over 300 commands](https://dbatools.io/commands) that help automate SQL Server tasks and encourage best practices.

Got ideas for new commands? Please propose them as [issues](https://dbatools.io/issues) and let us know what you'd like to see. Bug reports should also be filed under this repository's [issues](https://github.com/sqlcollaborative/dbatools/issues) section.

There's also over 1000 of us on the [SQL Server Community Slack](https://sqlcommunity.slack.com) in the #dbatools channel. Need an invite? Check out the [self-invite page](https://dbatools.io/slack/). Drop by if you'd like to chat about dbatools or even [join the team](https://dbatools.io/team)!

## Installer
This module is now in the PowerShell Gallery. Run the following from an administrative prompt to install:
```powershell
Install-Module dbatools
```

Or if you don't have a version of PowerShell that supports the Gallery, you can install it manually:
```powershell
Invoke-Expression (Invoke-WebRequest https://dbatools.io/in)
```

Note: please only use `Invoke-Expression (Invoke-WebRequest..)` from sources you trust, like us üëç

## Usage scenarios

In addition to the simple things you can do in SSMS (like starting a job), we've also read a whole bunch of docs and came up with commands that do nifty things quickly.

* Lost sysadmin access and need to regain entry to your SQL Server? Use [Reset-DbaAdmin](http://dbatools.io/Reset-DbaAdmin).
* Need to easily test your backups? Use [Test-DbaLastBackup](http://dbatools.io/Test-DbaLastBackup).
* SPN management got you down? Use [our suite of SPN commands](http://dbatools.io/schwifty) to find which SPNs are missing and easily add them.
* Got so many databases you can't keep track? Congrats on your big ol' environment! Use [Find-DbaDatabase](http://dbatools.io/Find-DbaDatabase) to easily find your database.

## Usage examples

As previously mentioned, dbatools now offers [over 300 commands](https://dbatools.io/commands)! [Here are some of the ones we highlight at conferences](https://gist.github.com/potatoqualitee/e8932b64aeb6ef404e252d656b6318a2) - PowerShell v3 and above required. (See below for important information about alternative logins and specifying SQL Server ports).

```powershell
# Set some vars
$new = "localhost\sql2016"
$old = $instance = "localhost"
$allservers = $old, $new

# Alternatively, use Registered Servers 
$allservers = Get-DbaRegisteredServer -SqlInstance $instance

# Need to restore a database? It can be as simple as this:
Restore-DbaDatabase -SqlInstance $instance -Path "C:\temp\AdventureWorks2012-Full Database Backup.bak"

# Use Ola Hallengren's backup script? We can restore an *ENTIRE INSTANCE* with just one line
Get-ChildItem -Directory \\workstation\backups\sql2012 | Restore-DbaDatabase -SqlInstance $new

# What about if you need to make a backup? And you are logging in with alternative credentials?
Get-DbaDatabase -SqlInstance $new -SqlCredential (Get-Credential sa) | Backup-DbaDatabase

# Testing your backups is crazy easy! 
Start-Process https://dbatools.io/Test-DbaLastBackup
Test-DbaLastBackup -SqlInstance $old | Out-GridView

# But what if you want to test your backups on a different server?
Test-DbaLastBackup -SqlInstance $old -Destination $new | Out-GridView

# Nowadays, we don't just backup databases. Now, we're backing up logins
Export-DbaLogin -SqlInstance $instance -Path C:\temp\logins.sql

$old | Get-DbaRunningJob

## Important Note

#### Alternative SQL Credentials

By default, all SQL-based commands will login to SQL Server using Trusted/Windows Authentication. To use alternative credentials, including SQL Logins or alternative Windows credentials, use the `-SqlCredential`. This parameter accepts the results of `Get-Credential` which generates a [PSCredential](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-credential?view=powershell-5.1) object.

```powershell
Get-DbaDatabase -SqlInstance sql2017 -SqlCredential (Get-Credential sqladmin)
```

<a href="https://dbatools.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cred.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6897" src="https://dbatools.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cred.jpg" alt="" width="322" height="261" /></a>

A few (or maybe just one - [Restore-DbaDatabase](/Restore-DbaDatabase)), you can also use `-AzureCredential`.

#### Alternative Windows Credentials

For commands that access Windows such as [Get-DbaDiskSpace](/Get-DbaDiskSpace), you will pass the `-Credential` parameter.

```powershell
$cred = Get-Credential ad\winadmin
Get-DbaDiskSpace -ComputerName sql2017 -Credential $cred
```

To store credentials to disk, please read more at [Jaap Brasser's blog](https://www.jaapbrasser.com/quickly-and-securely-storing-your-credentials-powershell/).

#### Servers with custom ports

If you use non-default ports and SQL Browser is disabled, you can access servers using a semicolon (functionality we've added) or a comma (the way Microsoft does it).

```powershell
-SqlInstance sql2017:55559
-SqlInstance 'sql2017,55559'
```

Note that PowerShell sees commas as arrays, so you must surround the host name with quotes.

## Support

dbatools aims to support as many configurations as possible, including

* PowerShell v3 and above
* SQL Server 2000 - 2017
* Express - Datacenter Edition
* Clustered and stand-alone instances
* Windows and SQL authentication
* Default and named instances
* Multiple instances on one server
* Auto-populated parameters for command-line completion (think -Database and -Login)
